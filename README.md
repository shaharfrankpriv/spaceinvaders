# spaceinvaders

A simple, non-interactive version of the classic Space Invaders game designed as an educational platform for learning Python programming fundamentals.

This implementation is based on AI-generated code (Claude 3.5) and serves as a starting point for students to explore simple programming concepts.

Students are guided to implement key game functions step by step, from basic ship movement to laser firing mechanics. The ultimate challenge is to prevent game over by programming the player's spaceship to fire lasers at strategic times.

The modular structure allows for numerous extensions and enhancements, making it an excellent project for progressive learning and creativity.

## Features

- Basic spaceship movement
- Laser shooting mechanics
- Invader movement and collision detection
- Game over conditions
